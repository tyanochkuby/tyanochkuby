🫂 I really enjoy inspecting GitHub and contributing to open source projects. I started doing that during my third semester and I really enjoyed helping people.

📽️ Beside studies and coding I watch a lot of movies ( https://letterboxd.com/okay_i_pull_up/ ) and brew coffee with *Aeropress* ☕.

📖 I also like reading a lot. My fav books are Jerusalem by Alan Moore and Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.
